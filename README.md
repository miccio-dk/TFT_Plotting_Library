# TFT Plotting Library

> Arduino library for generating real-time plots on a TFT_eSPI display object (e.g. ESP32 T-Display board)

Useful for showing sensor data on a screen.
Very much a WIP.

## Setup
- Download the repo
- Copy the .cpp and .h files into your project
- Follow example in .ino file for usage

## Roadmap
- Turn into proper library
- More configuration
- Different types of plots
